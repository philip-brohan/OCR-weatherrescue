Auto-transcription benchmark 1: Fort William pressures
======================================================

This is a benchmark dataset for document transcription tools. It contains a set of digital images - each showing a table of printed numbers, from :doc:`an old report <source>` -  and a transcription of all the numbers (from the `weatherrescue <http://weatherrescue.org>`_ volunteer transcription project).

The objective is to facilitate development and testing of automated tools for document transcription. Any such tools can be run on this set of images, and their results validated by comparison to the existing transcription.
